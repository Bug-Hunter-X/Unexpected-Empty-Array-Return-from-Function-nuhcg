# Unexpected Empty Array Return from MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB where a function returns an empty array (`[]`) instead of a scalar zero (0) under a specific condition.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues in larger programs.

## Problem
The `myFunction.m` file contains a function that, under certain circumstances, returns an empty array.  This is problematic if the calling function expects a numerical result.  Empty arrays can cause errors when used in calculations or comparisons.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the function. Instead of returning an empty array, it returns a scalar 0 when the condition is met.  This ensures consistent numerical output and prevents unexpected errors.
